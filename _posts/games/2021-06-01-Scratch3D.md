# Description
Scratch-3D is a 3D rendering engine I've been working on as a pet project.

I built it to have a playground for shader effects and any other graphics things I wanted to play with. It has a fully featured scene editor that allows for quick positioning and editing of shader properties. It can also serialize and load scenes to and from a json file.

I continue to tinker with it whenever I have spare time. I'm hoping to add Vulkan and/or DirectX support in the future as well as more editor features and potentially a runtime environment (If I need it).

# About the Project
**Made with:** C++, OpenGL, ImGui

**Role:** Sole Developer

**Project Length:** 3-ish months

My main motivation for starting this project was to learn a bit more about how rendering engines work under the hood and de-rust my C++ skills(since I mostly work in Unity).

I started by going through most of the tutorials on [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com/) to get a solid grasp on how it's rendering API worked. Once I had that that knowledge as a base I researched different rendering engine architectures to figure out what I wanted to go for. There's quite a bit of methods out there (which was a little overwhelming) but I settled on [Ogre3D](ogre3d.org/) as my primary inspiration since it was fairly mature, had good documentation and was fully open source.

I started hacking away on nights and weekends getting the basic structure together and rendering a simple scene with the nano-suit model. I quickly realized there was a lot of work that went into fully-featured 3D engines so I had to pick and choose carefully what features I would implement, find a library for, or just not do entirely to keep the project from ballooning out of control. A good example of this is how I opted not to use a custom memory manager and relied mainly on standard library smart pointers since the performance they provided was good enough for my purposes and it greatly simplified my memory management.

Once I had the basic scene working, I started adding editor features to make life easier for myself. I used ImGui as my UI library because it came highly recommended in custom-engine circles and I found the API to be very comfortable coming from a React background. I used ImGuizmo to quickly add a gizmo and transform editor to my scene and manipulate the entities I had created. One feature I'm particularly proud of is the pixel perfect mouse selection that uses a custom shader to render an object's ID to a buffer and cross-reference that with mouse position.

In addition to the new UI features I also added serialization for the entire scene. I chose JSON as my file format because it would be easy to debug and I had a lot of experience with it(even though it can be a little slow). Serialization and Deserialization changed a fair amount of my architecture and forced me to reckon with some unfortunate architecture decisions I made early on, but after some re-jiggering I was able to get it working with minimal hacks.

As of writing, this project has taken quite a bit of time and effort so I'm shelving it for the time being, but I will likely tinker with it some more when I get more time and find something I really want to implement using it.

**What I've done so far:** 

As a Gameplay Engineer on the Pokémon Go team, I've collaborated with designers to create tools to quickly tune the overall speed of our animations and transitions in the game, implemented advanced haptics to improve feedback and game feel, and am currently leading the (game client-side) technical design and engineering for a large upcoming gameplay feature (which I can't talk about just yet).

**Platforms:** Android, iOS

**Engine & Tools:** Unity

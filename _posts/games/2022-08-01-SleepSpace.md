**What I did:** 

Reunited again with the Where's My Keys team to create a card-based tactics game about overcoming your nightmares and trying to get a good night's sleep for the 2022 PIG-Squad Summer Slow Jam.

I designed the overall gameplay concept, implemented a flexible card system & turn order system, designed the cards, enemies and boss moves, and partnered with our lead artist to define and implement the camera setup & UI.

**Project Length:** 2 weeks

**Team Size:** 6

**Platforms:** WebGL, Windows, Android

**Engine & Tools:** Unity

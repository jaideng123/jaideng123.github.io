# About The Game
Challenge your friends in 1v1 or 2v2 competitions where both teams try to get THE BALL into the opposing team's goal to score points. Run, jump, fire explosive arrows, activate Clutch Mode to set up the perfect shot, or launch a devastating Super Arrow. Charge your Super Bar by defending your goal and spend it to activate Clutch Mode or your Super Arrow.

## Stages:

Each match takes place on one of 6 different stages with unique layouts and features
* HighRise - A no-frills stage in the ritzy part of town
* Arena - A simple, fast-paced stage with a large crowd to cheer you on
* Laser Dome - A stage that takes place in a swanky night-club, features disappearing blocks and a randomized layout
* HyperLoop - Play on top of a speeding train as hazards shift the play field around you
* Factory - Give the workers some entertainment on their lunch break in this stage with conveyor belts and a shrinking goal zone
* ClockTower - Play on the inside of a clock-tower as the stage rotates around you

## Super Arrows:

There are 8 Super Arrows all with unique effects and characteristics. Super Arrows consume a large chunk of your Super Bar so make sure to use them wisely.
* Warhead - Send THE BALL flying at max speed with a huge explosion
* Slicer - Cut THE BALL into 2 THE BALLs
* Repulsor - Create a protective force-field to repel THE BALL
* Grapple - Hook THE BALL and yank it towards you
* Smash - Become an arrow and send your body hurling towards THE BALL
* Volley - Shoot 9 small explosive arrows in an arc
* Rocket - Control a small rocket-powered arrow
* Laser - Shoot an arrow that bounces off of walls

## Clutch Mode:

You can activate Clutch Mode at any moment to slow down time and line up the perfect shot or make a last-minute save. Clutch Mode consumes your Super Bar as you use it so it won't last forever.

# About the Project:
**Made with:** Unity

**Project Length:** 1.5 Years

## The Story

After shipping TRITIX, I felt a strong desire to make a game that was wholely my own and didn't re-implement an existing game. One of the highlights of my time in college was getting together with a group of friends and spending hours playing games together like Super Smash Bros, Rocket League, and Duck Game. There was something about needing to make time to physically be with people and engage in some good-natured competition that I thought was really special so I set out to make a game that re-captured some of that magic.

The idea for the core mechanic just kind of came to me one night as I was laying down for bed and thinking about the mechanic in Breath of the Wild where time would slow when you jumped in the air and aimed your bow. I imagined a situation where that arrow exploded and sent a ball sailing into an opponent's goal, I felt excited just thinking about what that moment would be like, so over the next few days I worked out a rough prototype in Unity.

I was able to borrow a lot of the code from MowMowMow (which I thought this would just be a quick detour from), and fashioned a 2D character controller based on [Sebastian Lague's Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0f0hqURlhyIoAabKPgRsqjz). I worked first on nailing down the toy-ish aspect of just shooting a ball around with explosive arrows, making sure the interaction and behavior felt good before adding a second player. After getting the feel of the core mechanic just right, I whipped up a quick build with 2 players, unlimited arrows, and unlimited slo-mo time (which would later be clutch mode) and enlisted a friend of mine to help play-test. During the play-test my friend and I felt genuine tension and excitement and I knew I was on the right track, so I continued to iterate on the game in my free time over the next few months. During these months I worked on making the game a bit more interesting by adding complementary mechanics such as new movement options, Super Arrows, and multiple Stages to play on and play-testing with any friends that were interested. After my first 4-player play-test, I uploaded some footage on twitter and got [a surprisingly positive reaction](https://twitter.com/JaidenG123/status/1226030016124743685) (relative to the sparse number of followers I have) so I started thinking about how I wanted to release it.

With this being my first wholely original long-term project, I didn't want to work on it much longer that a year so I had set a deadline for completion sometime around June 2020. I decided early on that I wanted to focus on only local multiplayer in order to reduce scope and that I wanted to sell the game for a premium (not because I needed the money but mostly for the satisfaction of knowing someone thought it was worth speding money on) so I decided to go with Steam as it provided good discoverability and Steam Remote Play Together provided online play with very little effort required on my part. Before making my Steam page I researched a bit about how to structure them and came across this [wonderful GDC talk by Chris Zukowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJiv14uPOac) (Seriously, he's great, go read all his stuff [https://howtomarketagame.com/blog/](https://howtomarketagame.com/blog/)) which helped a lot in creating my page. I also cut together a simple trailer with some clips I had from previous play sessions. I launched my Steam page and started getting a veeeerrrrryyyy slow trickle of wish-lists, but I was just happy that there were people out there who liked what they saw enough to wish-list at all.

By June, I reached my internal deadline and had the game content-complete with 8 Super Arrows and 6 Stages. From here I thought about releasing early(My public launch window was late 2020), but instead I decided to submit the game to some festivals hoping that could help get a bit more buzz or at the very least, some useful feedback to make the game better. In the end I entered ArrowBall into both Indiecade and Seattle Indie Expo. My experience with Indiecade was less than stellar. It was pretty expensive, the submission process required a lot of documentation, and in the end none of the keys I provided were ever redeemed and I have yet to receive any written feedback (which I had to pay extra for) 6 months after submission. Luckily, my experience with Seattle Indie Expo was the complete opposite.Tthe submission form was short, the fee was dirt cheap, and even though I didn't get a nomination, I got a lot of invaluable feedback that really helped improve the game.

Even though I had a few months before my planned launch there was still a lot of work that needed to be done.

## Lessons Learned

- Play-Test with more than just your friends, get as much feedback as possible (even if you don't use all of it)
- Leverage your local game-dev community
- Don't launch your Steam page cold and without a trailer (This will hurt you with THE ALGORITHM)
- Invest in good capsule images for your Steam Page (Still trying to figure out how to find an artist for this)
- Do some research into the viability of the genre you're tackling (avoid making 4 player local multiplayer-only games)
    - Just make sure it's something you can succeed in based on level of complexity + expectations of audience for art, etc.
    - Be mindful of and minimize any accessibility barriers (IE needing a controller on PC, Friends)
- Spend time developing an interesting visual style for your game (expectations these days are quite high on this front)
    - Twitter is a great place to A/B test these things
    - Shaders, Particles, Effects, and Asset Stores are all accessible tools for programmers to make things look better w/o much artistic flair
- Avoid festivals that cost money and don't guarantee prompt, useful feedback if they don't pick your game *(Cough IndieCade Cough)*
    - Local festivals (Shout-out to [Seattle Indie Expo](https://six.seattleindies.org/)) are usually your best bet
    - This of course changes if your game has more buzz, a larger audience, or appeals more to organizers

But most of all if you are making a game on your own **Be compassionate with yourself** the things you are doing are often handled by multiple teams of people at larger studios, you will not get everything right, you will not know everything, you will likely not succeed like you hoped you would, you are still learning, most people are still learning.

# Description
ArrowBall is an Indie Sports game where you use explosive arrows and acrobatics to outmaneuver your opponents and control THE BALL on a variety of unique Stages.

## Features:
*  Engage in thrilling local multiplayer matches with 2-4 Friends/Enemies
* Master 8 different Super Arrows with devastating and tricky effects, Like the Slicer which cuts the ball in half!
*  Play Across 6 Stages with unique layouts and mechanics
*  Send THE BALL on the trip of a lifetime into your opponent's goal

## How It works:
Each Match of ArrowBall centers around 2 teams (Red and Blue) each with their own goal, and THE BALL.The objective of each team is to get THE BALL into their opponent's goal using a quiver of regenerating arrows to send THE BALL flying across the stage.
Over the course of the match you will start to build up your Super Bar, which you can spend to slow down time when things get too hectic or you want to set up the perfect shot on your opponent's goal. You can also spend the Super Bar to unleash a Super Arrow (which each player selects before the match) with a unique effect.
The Matches are first-to-8 Points, with an 8 minute timer to keep games fast and thrilling.

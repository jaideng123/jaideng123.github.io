# About The Game
Challenge your friends in 1v1 or 2v2 competitions where both teams try to get THE BALL into the opposing team's goal to score points. Run, jump, fire explosive arrows, activate Clutch Mode to set up the perfect shot, or launch a devastating Super Arrow. Charge your Super Bar by defending your goal and spend it to activate Clutch Mode or your Super Arrow.

## Stages:

Each match takes place on one of 6 different stages with unique layouts and features
* HighRise - A no-frills stage in the ritzy part of town
* Arena - A simple, fast-paced stage with a large crowd to cheer you on
* Laser Dome - A stage that takes place in a swanky night-club, features disappearing blocks and a randomized layout
* HyperLoop - Play on top of a speeding train as hazards shift the play field around you
* Factory - Give the workers some entertainment on their lunch break in this stage with conveyor belts and a shrinking goal zone
* ClockTower - Play on the inside of a clock-tower as the stage rotates around you

## Super Arrows:

There are 8 Super Arrows all with unique effects and characteristics. Super Arrows consume a large chunk of your Super Bar so make sure to use them wisely.
* Warhead - Send THE BALL flying at max speed with a huge explosion
* Slicer - Cut THE BALL into 2 THE BALLs
* Repulsor - Create a protective force-field to repel THE BALL
* Grapple - Hook THE BALL and yank it towards you
* Smash - Become an arrow and send your body hurling towards THE BALL
* Volley - Shoot 9 small explosive arrows in an arc
* Rocket - Control a small rocket-powered arrow
* Laser - Shoot an arrow that bounces off of walls

## Clutch Mode:

You can activate Clutch Mode at any moment to slow down time and line up the perfect shot or make a last-minute save. Clutch Mode consumes your Super Bar as you use it so it won't last forever.

# About the Project:
**Made with:** Unity

**Project Length:** 1.5 Years

After shipping TRITIX, I felt a strong desire to make a game that was wholely my own and didn't re-implement an existing game. One of the highlights of my time in college was getting together with a group of friends and spending hours playing games together like Super Smash Bros, Rocket League, and Duck Game. There was something about needing to make time to physically be with people and engage in some good-natured competition that I thought was really special so I set out to make a game that re-captured some of that magic.

The idea for the core mechanic just kind of came to me one night as I was laying down for bed and thinking about the mechanic in Breath of the Wild where time would slow when you jumped in the air and aimed your bow. I imagined a situation where that arrow exploded and sent a ball sailing into an opponent's goal, I felt excited just thinking about what that moment would be like, so over the next few days I worked out a rough prototype in Unity.

I was able to borrow a lot of the code from MowMowMow (which I thought this would just be a quick detour from), and fashioned a 2D character controller based on [Sebastian Lague's Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0f0hqURlhyIoAabKPgRsqjz). I worked first on nailing down the toy-ish aspect of just shooting a ball around with explosive arrows, making sure the interaction and behavior felt good before adding a second player. After getting the feel of the core mechanic just right, I whipped up a quick build with 2 players, unlimited arrows, and unlimited slo-mo time (which would later be clutch mode) and enlisted a friend of mine to help play-test. During the play-test my friend and I felt genuine tension and excitement and I knew I was on the right track, so I continued to iterate on the game in my free time over the next few months. During these months I worked on making the game a bit more interesting by adding complementary mechanics such as new movement options, Super Arrows, and multiple Stages to play on.

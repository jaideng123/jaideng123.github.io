# Description
In Distanced you must quickly erect structures to shelter an increasingly unruly population from a deadly virus.

Each round, a member of your population will become sick and you must stop the spread to earn as many points as possible. After each round, your population will increase, or they will decrease but become even harder to control. Try to get the highest score you can and save them from themselves!

# About the Project
**Made with:** Unity

**Role:** Sole Developer

**Project Length:** 3 days

I made this project for the Weekly Game Jam 152 where the theme was Shelter.

I was the sole developer on this project and came up with the design & visuals, did the programming, and selected the Music & Sound Effects.
This was my first experience participating in a game-jam, I stumbled upon it while it while taking a small break from ArrowBall and when I saw the theme I immediately had an idea that I thought could be fun and that I knew I could do on my own.

It took me about a day to create the core game-play of painting the walls and having the balls move around, another day to create the structure of the game (scoring, rounds, etc.), then finally a day for general polish (better UI, music, sound effects, colors).

On the programming side of things, this was my first time using DOTween and I really enjoyed it, especially for adding some quick "bounce" to various UI elements, definitely something I'm going to use for future Unity projects.

Overall, I'm pretty proud of how this game turned out, the core gameplay is very engaging, the structure provides a nice zen rhythm that ramps up in pressure, and the physics-based nature of the balls leads to some fun moments of panic. From a design-perspective it feels very complete for being such a small experience.

**What I did:** 

Once again worked with with the Where's My Keys team to create a deck-building survival-stealth roguelike about the beauty and terror of nature for the 2023 7 Day Roguelike Jam.

I designed the overall gameplay concept and programmed the entirety of the game including (but not limited to) level design tools, wildlife AI, pathfinding, procedural generation, card system, etc.

**Project Length:** 1 week

**Team Size:** 5

**Platforms:** WebGL, Windows

**Engine & Tools:** Unity

**What I did:** 

Created a tweening framework plugin for Unreal Engine (similar to DOTween in Unity) that is convenient and easy to use with both C++ and Blueprint APIs, while also being fast, memory efficient, and scalable.

Currently I am testing it out as a local plugin in Yuu Recreations Bowling before a wider release.

**Engine & Tools:** Unreal Engine, C++

# Description
Working on a tweening framework plugin for Unreal Engine (similar to DOTween in Unity) that is fast, memory efficient, and scalable while also being convenient to use by supporting usage in both C++ and Blueprints.

Current features:
- Provides an extended library of easing functions (more than what Unreal supports out of the box).
- Lean and efficient using ~1.5mb memory and ticking at <1ms for 4000 concurrent tweens.
- Use reflection to conveniently tween UProperties with via field names.
- Both Blueprint & C++ APIs.


Full plugin release is still pending, for now it lives as a local plugin in the [Yuu Bowling Github Repo](https://github.com/jaideng123/UnrealBowling/tree/master/Plugins/DUETween) while I work out all the kinks.

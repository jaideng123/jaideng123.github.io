**What I did:** 

Created a tweening framework plugin for Unreal Engine (similar to DOTween in Unity) that is convenient and easy to use with both C++ and Blueprint APIs, while also being fast, memory efficient, and scalable.

**Engine & Tools:** Unreal Engine, C++

# Description
DUETween is a framework that allows you to add quick & easy animations to actors in your Unreal Engine games. It provides APIs for both Blueprint and C++ and aims to be flexible, yet memory and runtime efficient.

I built DUETween because I fell in love with [DOTween](https://dotween.demigiant.com/) while making Unity games and couldn't find any existing plugins in Unreal that replicated it's power and ease of use.

**Current features:**
   * Provides an extended library of easing functions (See [easings.net](https://easings.net/)).
   * Lean and efficient using ~1.5mb memory and ticking at <0.5ms for 4000 concurrent tweens.
   * Out of the box functionality for common tweens like location and rotation.
   * Use reflection to conveniently tween UProperties with via field names.
   * Both Blueprint & C++ APIs.

Full plugin is available on [Github](https://github.com/jaideng123/DUETween)!

Used to build [Yuu Recreations: Bowling](/games/YuuBowling/)

# How does it work?
## C++ API:
To get you started there are some handy methods to do common tasks like rotation and movement:
{% highlight cpp %}
// Basic Movement:
DUETween::DueMove(this, TargetLocation, 1.0);
// Basic Rotation:
DUETween::DUERotate(this, TargetRotation, 1.0);
// 2D Movement (for UI elements mainly):
DUETween::DueMove2D(this, Target2DLocation, 1.0);
{% endhighlight %}
Every tween can be used with an of the [available easing functions](https://github.com/jaideng123/DUETween/blob/main/Source/DUETween/Public/DUEEasingFunctionLibrary.h):
{% highlight cpp %}
DUETween::DueMove(this, TargetLocation, 1.0, EDueEasingType::Linear);
{% endhighlight %}
If you have a specific property on a UObject you want to tween you can reference it by name:
{% highlight cpp %}
DUETween::StartDUETween<float>(this,"MyProperty", 50.0, 1.0);
{% endhighlight %}
Each tween returns a handle that you can use to control playback as well as modify tween properties:
{% highlight cpp %}
FActiveDUETweenHandle Handle = DUETween::DueMove(this, TargetLocation, 1.0);
// Stop and cancel tween
Handle.StopTween();
// Pause and resume tween
Handle.PauseTween();
Handle.Resume();
// Updates the step count (chunkiness) of the tween
Handle.SetSteps(10);
// Updates whether or not this tween should yoyo (return to it's starting position)
Handle.SetYoYo(true);
// Updates Number Of Loops this tween will do before completing (-1 = infinite)
Handle.SetLoopCount(-1);
// Binds a completion event
FTweenCompleteCallback& CompletionCallback;
Handle.OnComplete(CompletionCallback);
{% endhighlight %}
(C++ Only) You can also use Lambdas for custom tweens, here's an example where I use a lambda tween to evaluate a custome curve:
{% highlight cpp %}
const FVector TargetLocation = BallGripStartPosition.GetValue() + GetActorForwardVector() *
  StartDistance;
const FVector StartPosition = BallGripStartPosition.GetValue();
FTweenUpdateCallback TargetCallback = [TargetLocation,StartPosition,Curve = RunUpCurve.GetRichCurveConst(), this](
  const FValueContainer& UpdatedValue)
{
  const FVector CurrentLocation = FMath::Lerp(StartPosition, TargetLocation,
                                              Curve->Eval(UpdatedValue.GetSubtype<float>()));
  this->SetActorLocation(CurrentLocation);
};
DUETween::StartDUETween<float>(this, TargetCallback, 0.0, 1.0, RunUpTimeMS);
{% endhighlight %}
## Blueprint API:
Documentation coming soon (for now refer to C++, the nodes match the functions available there)

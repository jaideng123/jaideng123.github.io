**What I did:** 

Working on a tweening framework plugin for Unreal Engine (similar to DOTween in Unity) that is fast, memory efficient, and scalable while also being convient to use with both C++ and Blueprint APIs.

Currently I am testing it out as a local plugin in Yuu Bowling before a wider release.

**Engine & Tools:** Unreal Engine, C++

# Description
Working on a tweeening framework plugin for Unreal Engine (similar to DOTween in Unity) that is fast, memory efficient, and scalable while also being convient to use by supporting usage in both C++ and Blueprints.

Current features:
- Supports extended library of easing functions.
- Lean and efficient using ~1.5mb memory and ticking at <1ms for 4000 concurrent tweens.
- Uses reflection to conveniently tween UPropertys with only a field name.
- Blueprint & C++ APIs.



Full plugin release is still pending, for now it lives in the [Yuu Bowling Github Repo](https://github.com/jaideng123/UnrealBowling/tree/master/Plugins/DUETween) while I work out all the kinks.

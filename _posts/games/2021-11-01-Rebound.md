**What I did:** 

Reunited with (most of) the Where's My Keys team to create a relaxing game about repairing old books over 2 weeks for the 2021 Seattle Indies Slow Jam.

Since the programmer I partnered with on the previous projects was unavailable, I acted as the sole engineer and gameplay designer for the project.

I created a system for painting arbitrary models, a small art pipeline + system for procedural generation of books to repair, a guided tutorial system, a few easter eggs, and pretty much everything related to the overall flow of the game.


**Project Length:** 2 weeks

**Team Size:** 5

**Platforms:** WebGL, Windows (itch.io)

**Engine & Tools:** Unity

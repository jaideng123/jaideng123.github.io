# About the Project:
This was my first game that I made with Unity and was made over the course of a year of on & off development in my spare time.

I was the sole developer and handled everything including the programming, UI design, finding suitable Assets, release on Google Play, etc.

If you are curious about how it was made, I've opened up the entire codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaideng123/TRITIX)

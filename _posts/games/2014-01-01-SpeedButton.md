# Description
SpeedButton is a game about tapping a moving button on your phone in a variety of modes

## Modes:
* Time Trial - Press the button as many times as possible within a time limit
* Race - Press the button 30 times in the least amount of time
* Arcade - Keep the pressing going by reaching score thresholds to give yourself more time
* Blackout - Press the red button while avoiding pressing the black 

Each mode has separately tracked high scores

# About the Project:
**Made with:** Android SDK

**Role:** Programmer & Gameplay Designer

**Project Length:** 2 Days

This project was developed over the course of 24 hours for the TAMU Hack 2014 hackathon, essentially as a joke. I worked with 4 other students to develop both the initial concept and the 4 modes.

Even though it didn't go anywhere, I'm still proud that we were able to execute on an idea so quickly (especially because none of us had never even made an android app before) and it holds a special place in my heart as my first game.

        <p>
            I'm an engineer, designer, and independent game creator with 7 years of experience in the games & software
            industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to make games that bring a tiny bit of joy to people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days I'm working at Niantic on <a href="/games/PokemonGo/">Pokemon Go</a>, trying to get people to go
            out, explore the world, and make new friends through the lens of Pokemon.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past, I've worked at Amazon on an internal game project, released <a
                href="/games/ArrowBall/">ArrowBall</a> on Steam in 2020, and
            made some <a href="/games/Rebound/">award-winning game jam projects</a>. You can find a full list of the
            things I've worked on on my <a href="/games/">portfolio page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I write about projects I'm working on or cool things I've learned about on my <a
                href="/blog/">blog</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to working on my own games, I volunteer my time with Seattle Indies to host social events for
            local game developers and provide
            mentorship to others in the games industry.
